## New Features Added

### Feature 1: Detailed Playlist View
- **Implementation**: Uses basic for loops to iterate through arrays
- **Visual Enhancement**: 
  - Star visualization (★★★☆☆) created with for loops
  - Formatted sections with dividers
  - Enhanced emoji usage
  - Professional layout with clear separations

- **Array Usage**: 
```kotlin
// Using basic for loop for detailed view
for (i in 0 until currentSize) {
    // Process each song with array access
    result += "♪ Title: ${songTitles[i]}\n"
    // Star visualization with nested for loop
    for (j in 1..5) {
        if (j <= ratingNum) stars += "★" else stars += "☆"
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: Average Rating Calculator
- **Implementation**: Uses basic for loops and arrays for calculation
- **Features**:
  - Calculates average using mathematical operations
  - Shows individual song ratings
  - Displays calculation breakdown
  - Provides rating interpretation based on average

- **Array Usage**:
```kotlin
// Using basic for loop to calculate average
for (i in 0 until currentSize) {
    val rating = ratings[i].toDoubleOrNull()
    if (rating != null) {
        totalRating += rating
        validRatings++
    }
}
```

## Key Technical Implementation

### Basic Arrays Usage
- **Fixed Size**: `Array(4)` for maximum 4 songs
- **Manual Indexing**: `currentSize` variable tracks used slots
- **For Loop Iteration**: All operations use `for (i in 0 until currentSize)`

### For Loop Examples
1. **Adding Songs**: Array assignment with index tracking
2. **Clearing Data**: For loop to reset all array elements
3. **Display Generation**: For loops to build formatted strings
4. **Average Calculation**: For loop to sum ratings and count
5. **Star Visualization**: Nested for loops for rating display

### Data Structure
```kotlin
var songTitles = Array(4) { "" }    // Basic string array
var artistNames = Array(4) { "" }   // Basic string array  
var ratings = Array(4) { "" }       // Basic string array
var comments = Array(4) { "" }      // Basic string array
var currentSize = 0                 // Manual size tracking
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `PlaylistData.kt` - Array-based data management with for loops
- `PlaylistActivity.kt` - Enhanced playlist display with new features
- `README.md` - App documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified:
- `MainActivity.kt` - Updated to use array-based data structure
- `activity_main.xml` - Professional layout with proper labels

- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Updated activity registration
- `strings.xml` - Updated app name

## Testing Scenarios

The app handles these scenarios correctly:

1. **Adding songs within limit**: Successfully adds 1-4 songs using arrays
2. **Exceeding 4-song limit**: Shows error message, prevents addition
3. **Invalid input**: Shows appropriate error messages
4. **Empty playlist**: Shows "No songs" message in all views
5. **Detailed view**: Shows enhanced formatting with stars
6. **Average calculation**: Calculates and displays average with breakdown
7. **View switching**: Toggles between basic, detailed, and average views
8. **Clearing playlist**: Resets all arrays using for loops
9. **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between activities

## Build Requirements

- Java 11+ (current system has Java 8, needs upgrade)
